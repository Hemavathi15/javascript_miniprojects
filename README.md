# My Personal Projects Repository

Welcome to my personal projects repository! 
Here, you'll find a collection of small projects I've created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
Each project showcases different aspects of web development and my journey in learning and experimenting with these technologies.

## Projects

### 1. **Calculator**
Sure! Here are the descriptions for your projects:

### 1. **Calculator**
This project is a basic calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It performs simple arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
The main goal was to practice JavaScript functions and user input handling. The calculator has a clean and intuitive interface, making it easy to use.

### 2. **Counter**
In this project, I created a simple counter application.
Users can increase the count by clicking the plus button and decrease it by clicking the minus button.
This project helped me understand DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript. The counter updates dynamically and provides immediate feedback to the user.

### 3. **Image Expanding**
This project features an image gallery where clicking on an image expands it to show more details.
The main focus was on practicing CSS transitions and JavaScript event handling.
When an image is clicked, it smoothly expands to a larger size, providing a visually appealing effect.
